# Greasing the groove
This project contains simple implementation, with some common pitfalls, for a wide veriety of ML models. This serves a couple of purposes:<br />

1. Knowledge bank: whenever I want to implement / test a quick algorithm I can just take one of the shelf<br />
2. Hands on experience with the implementation of these models<br />
3. Exploring some of the pitfalls of methods<br />
4. Provides a space to test out new methods and techniques<br />
