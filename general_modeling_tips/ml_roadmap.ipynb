    "Before we jump right into programming, we should lay out a brief guide to keep us on track. The following steps form the basis for any machine learning workflow once we have a problem and model in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the question and determine required data\n",
    "2. Acquire the data in accessible format\n",
    "3. Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required\n",
    "4. Prepare the data for the ml model\n",
    "5. Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed\n",
    "6. Train the model on the training data\n",
    "7. Make predictions on the test data\n",
    "8. Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics\n",
    "9. If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique\n",
    "    1. Do some hyperparameter tuning (check out the hyperparameter tuning notebook in the general modeling tips folder)\n",
    "10. Interpret model results visually and numerically"
